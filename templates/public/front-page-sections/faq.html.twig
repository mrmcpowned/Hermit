            <h2>What is a hackathon?</h2>

            <p>A hackathon is an event where students of all academic backgrounds and skill levels come together to
                solve problems by using technology.</p>

            <p>Students form groups and create projects that tackle these challenges, all while attending workshops to
                develop new skills, receiving mentorship from industry leaders, and networking with recruiters from top
                companies.</p>

            <p>ShellHacks is organized by Upsilon Pi Epsilon (UPE), the Honor Society for the Computing and Information
                Disciplines, with support from companies, academic programs, and student organizations.</p>

            <h2>Is there a theme?</h2>
            <p>Our theme focuses on diversity, and not just from an academic standpoint. Miami is a cultural melting
                pot full of people from all walks of life, with
                <a href="http://www.fiu.edu/about-us/" target="_blank">FIU being no exception</a>.</p>

            <h2>Sounds cool. So, can I come?</h2>

            <p>If you're a current college/university student or a recent graduate (up to 1 year), you're more than
                welcome to attend! The event is open to students of all academic backgrounds and skill levels, so
                whether you’re an aspiring artist or an expert engineer, there’s a place for you at ShellHacks.</p>

            <h2>Wait, I don't know how to code!</h2>

            <p>Don't worry, one of the core principles of a hackathon is learning! There'll be several workshops
                throughout the event, ranging from beginner to advanced, so there's always something new to learn.</p>

            <h2>Will there be food?</h2>

            <p>There will be food. Lots of food. LOTS. Miami's food scene is diverse, so there’s always something for
                everyone. We’ll do our best to accommodate for any dietary restriction as well, just make sure to let us
                know come registration time.</p>

            <p>There’s also coffee, energy drinks, and tea if you want to keep it classy.</p>

            <h2>Do I need to already have a group?</h2>

            <p>Nope. You can go solo, come with your own team (no more than 4), or participate in a group mixer we'll
                have before hacking begins to find a group.</p>

            <h2>This sounds expensive. Can I afford it?</h2>

            <p>Can you afford FREE?! The event is entirely free for attendees, so the only thing you need to worry about
                is learning, developing cool projects, and enjoying the event!</p>

            <h2>Will there be travel reimbursement?</h2>

            <p>As much as we'd love to bring everyone and make this event as accessible as possible, sadly we can't
                offer financial reimbursement for travel this year. We will be sending a coach bus to select schools in the Florida
                area to get eager hackers to FIU, though!</p>

            <h2>So, why ‘ShellHacks’?</h2>
            <p>Well, it started off as a joke about what a turtle-themed hackathon would be called. Later on, we
                actually started thinking about organizing a hackathon, but instead of turtles, we decided to focus
                on diversity in Miami. Since the city has an abundance of seashells on its beaches, the name
                stuck.</p>

            <p>It's also a play on words about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing)"
                                                  target="_blank">
                    computer shells</a>, but that’s just to draw attention away from all the turtle puns.</p>
