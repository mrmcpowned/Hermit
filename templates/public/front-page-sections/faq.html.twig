            <h2>Do I need to already have a group?</h2>

            <p>Nope. You can go solo, come with your own team (no more than 4), or participate in a group mixer we'll have before hacking begins to find a group.</p>

            <h2>So, why ‘ShellHacks’?</h2>

            <p>Well, it started off as a joke about what a turtle-themed hackathon would be called. Later on, we actually started thinking about organizing a hackathon, but instead of turtles, we decided to focus on diversity in Miami. Since the city has an abundance of seashells on its beaches, the name stuck.</p>

            <p>It's also a play on words about computer shells, but that’s just to draw attention away from all the turtle puns.</p>
